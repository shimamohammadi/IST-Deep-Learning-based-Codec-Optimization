# IST-Deep-Learning-based-Codec-Optimization

Six different images from JPEG-AI test was compressed in three diffrent bitrates correspond to low, midium, and high qualities using VAE-Hyper-X codec, where X is the image quality metric used in the optimization. The compressed images are available in Images/.<br />
Decoded images were evaluated by people through a pairwise subjective test via Amazon mechanical Turk (AMT) in three different sessions. The winning frequency of each session was calculated and reported in the results/. <br />

- Image quality metics:
  - MSE: Mean Squared Error
  - SSIM: Structural Similarity Index Metric
  - MS-SSIM: Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index Metric
  - FSIM: A feature similarity index for image quality assessment
  - GMSD: Gradient magnitude similarity deviation: A highly efficient perceptual image quality index
  - LPIPS: Image quality assessment: Unifying structure and texture similarity
  - DISTS: Perceptual image quality assessment using a normalized laplacian pyramid
  - NLPD: Normalized Laplacian Pyramid Distance
  - VSI: A visual saliency-induced index for perceptual image quality assessment
